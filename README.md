# C.R.U.D. Comment Feed

This app was developed as a project to learn how to interact with APIs for the purpose of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. I had a lot of fun working on this short project and was able to apply my own styling to it. However, the main focus of the project was to get a solid grasp on the basics of interacting between the site and the API.
